\subsection{Basic Equation}
The equation representing a straight line in the Cartesian plane is of the form $ax+by+c=0$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ are constant

\subsection{Basic Equation - with space management}

The equation representing a straight line in the Cartesian plane is of the form
$$
ax+by+c=0
$$
where $a$, $b$, $c$ are constants.

\subsection{Superscript}

In the seventeenth century, Fermat conjectured that if $n>2$, then
there are no integers $x$, $y$, $z$ for which
$$
x^n+y^n=z^n.
$$
This was proved in 1994 by Andrew Wiles

\paragraph{Be Careful of such equations: } It is easily seen that $(x^m)^n=x^{mn}$ can have mistake like $(x^m)^n=x^mn$.

\subsection{Superscript of a superscript}

Numbers of the form $2^{2^n}+1$, where $n$ is a natural number, are called Fermat numbers.

\subsection{Subscript}

The sequence $(x_n)$ defined by
$$
x_1=1, \quad x_2=1,\quad x_n=x_{n-1}+x_{n-2}\;\;(n>2)
$$
is called the Fibonacci sequence.

\subsection{Subscript and Superscript together}

If the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $a$, then the sequence
$(x_n^2)$ converges to $a^2$

\subsection{Square-root and Cube-root}

Which is greater $\sqrt[4]{5}$ or $\sqrt[5]{4}$?

The root sign elongates automatically, $2\sqrt{2}$\,,\quad $2^2\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}$

\subsection{Creating Mathematical Equation without numbering the equation}

The equation representing a straight line in the Cartesian plane is of the form
\begin{equation*}
ax+by+c=0  
\end{equation*}
where $a$, $b$, $c$ are constants.

\subsection{Creating Mathematical Equation with numbering the equation}

The equation representing a straight line in the Cartesian plane is of the form
\begin{equation}
ax+by+c=0  
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$, $c$ are constants.


\subsection{Creating Mathematical Equation - multiline }

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
(a+b+c+d+e+f)ˆ2 & = aˆ2+bˆ2+cˆ2+dˆ2+eˆ2+fˆ2\\
&\quad +2ab+2ac+2ad+2ae+2af\\
&\quad +2bc+2bd+2be+2bf\\
&\quad +2cd+2ce+2cf\\
&\quad +2de+2df\\
&\quad +2ef
\end{split}
\end{equation*}


\subsection{Creating Mathematical Equation - multiple equations in group }

Thus $x$, $y$ and $z$ satisfy the equations
\begin{align*}
x+y-z & = 1\\
x-y+z & = 1\\
\intertext{and by hypothesis}
x+y+z & =1
\end{align*}

\subsection{Creating Sequence and indicating infinite series }

Consider a finite sequence $X_1,X_2,\dots$, its sum $X_1+X_2+\dots$ and product $X_1X_2\dots$.

\subsection{Creating Delimiter - Brackets }

\begin{equation*}
(x+y)ˆ2-(x-y)ˆ2=((x+y)+(x-y))((x+y)-(x-y))=4xy
\end{equation*}
