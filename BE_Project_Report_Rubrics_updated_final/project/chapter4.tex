\chapter{Results and Discussion }
During the development of project research was conducted based on similar systems, it was found that none of the systems were developed in a user friendly manner and none of them implemented systems both for android as well as web application.
During the development of the application it was kept in mind that system will be developed both platform android as well as web application.
Creation of rubrics is given as a option to the user to create its own with ease. The user will be entering the criteria based on the assessment and marks will be distributed by the user on each of the criteria.
During the research it was also seen that grading system was not implemented with clarity.Hence that anomaly was taken a account during the development of the project.
Once the assessment of the students are done user will be able to visualize data in graphs as well as they will be able to perform statistical analysis of the data. User will be able to send the assessment to the students via mail.
